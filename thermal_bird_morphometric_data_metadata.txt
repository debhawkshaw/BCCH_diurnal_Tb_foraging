Description: 
Morphometric data recorded at each capture of the two birds in the dataset that were not able to be sexed molecularly (Ring-numbers: 2960-72716 and 2960-72801). This data was used to determine sex via a descriminant function. If there was multiple captures were morphometric data was available, the average of the measurements was calculated. Measurements taken by Jan J. Wijmenga.

Varaibles:
CatchLocationID: The location ID of the feeder that the bird was captured at. During this study was always "Feeder14A", the thermal feeder.
CatchDate: Date of the bird was captured, format is YYYY-MM-DD.
CatchRingNumber: The unique number on the aluminum leg band the chicadee recieved upon first capture. 
BodyMassField: The body mass of the chickadee during the capture. Measured in grams. 
WingLength: Wing length of the chickadee measured in millimeters. 
Tarsus: Tarus length of the chickadee measured in millimeters.
